
Hello friends!

I'm excited for you to see the Vault I've been working on. It requires a program called Obsidian.
Obsidian refers to a large collection of ideas in the form of files as a "Vault".
When I refer to a "Vault" I am usually referring to the folder on this drive.

~~~
Q: What is obsidian?

A: "Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking application that operates on markdown files." - Google
~~~

It's just a note-taking software. Specifically, it's a highly versatile text editor,
We're going to abuse it with content it was never originally meant for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to access the Vault:

~~~
Step I: Download the latest release on the right side of this page.

Step II: Extract the contents of the zip file and Move and/or copy the folder labeled Vault(Version number) to somewhere on your computer (~1 GB). Any place you store miscellaneous files could be suitable.

Step III: Download and install Obsidian MD from their website (290 MB).
https://obsidian.md/

Step IV: Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault" and navigate to the Vault(Version number) folder you placed onto your computer. Select the folder.

Step V: When the Vault opens, it will ask if you trust the author and if you want to use restricted mode. Trust the author and keep restricted mode OFF.
This is necessary to allow the usermade plugins in the Vault to function correctly.
The Vault will show a progress bar or counter on the right side of the screen. Allow the progress bar to finish before continuing.

Step VI: Read the "README From Mitch" in the Vault and Enjoy! Let me know if you have any issues.

Notes:

Please read the "README From Mitch" in the Vault before asking a bunch of questions. It should be the first file you see when you open the Vault.
I think it will answer many of your questions.

I have not checked how this runs on weaker computers. It might not work for you if you have a weak machine.

This Vault was developed in Windows. It may function on other OS's but I wouldn't recommend it.
