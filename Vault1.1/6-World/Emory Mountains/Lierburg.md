## History

The Castle of Lierburg is far older than the rest of the settlement. It was said to have been built by Man many hundreds of years ago, but the foundations of the castle are Elven and much, much older. The "Cellars" of Lierburg are famously deep and elegant and comprise of beautifully preserved second era Elven architecture. Because of this, the wines of these valleys have historically been highly coveted.
