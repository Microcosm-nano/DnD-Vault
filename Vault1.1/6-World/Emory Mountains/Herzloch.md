## Overview

Herzloch is a dreary town nestled in a valley in the Emory Mountains. It is a gateway town for the rest of the mountain range. As such, it receives a lot of commerce and foot traffic from those wishing to travel the pass from [[Lierburg]] before Winter. Herzloch is home to many shops and amenities.

### Scenery
![[Herzloch.jpg|600]]

*Herzloch is often beset by rain due to it's lower altitude in the valley. It keeps the citizens warmer, but it makes for a gloomy sight.*

## History

Herzloch has historically been an important destination for scholars and spellcasters due to the [[Herzloch College of the Arcane]] that used to be active here, but those days have long since passed. [[The Murder]] Has been in power over Herzloch for the last several years. Extortion and fearmongering have been the new daily norm for it's citizens as the group exerts their power here with an iron fist.  The citizenry are hesitant to resist or talk about matters concerning the gang due to their surveillance and omnipresence in the city.
