## Overview

Illsprout, despite it's ironic name, is known as one of the agricultural staples of the Emory mountains. A large fertile valley fed by fresh water from melting glaciers provides for an abnormally long growing season compared to the rest of the region. Illsprout prides itself in it's farmers and growers abilities, providing much of the needed sustenance for surrounding communities in years of poor harvests. The village's appearance reflects it's prosperous condition. The buildings of Illsprout are well taken care of and adorned with ornate features befitting of a much larger town.  

### Scenery

*Sprouts gather around a common area outside of a tavern, enjoying their fill of food and drink during a ceremonial feasting holiday, of which they have many. Another successful harvest brings about a sense of security and prosperity for the coming winter.*

## History

Illsprout's reputation as an agricultural hub dates back before the first recorded history of Humankind in the region. The Dwarvish historical records of the area show this valley was used for overworld farms by the dwarves for a few hundred years before the first Human settlers came to the valley. The dwarves, despite their advanced underground farming techniques, benefitted greatly from having  an overworld farm, supplemented by sunlight. Illsprout has many feasting festivals and holidays throughout the year, but none compare to the grandeur and revelry of the Yam Festival. The town ruptures to life in celebration of this special crop. Food and drink are enjoyed aplenty as celebrators crown the [[Izzy|Yam King]]
