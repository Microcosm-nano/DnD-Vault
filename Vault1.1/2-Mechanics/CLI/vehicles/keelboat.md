One of the smallest sailing vessels, keelboats can be sailed or rowed by a single person. These ships often transport small amounts of cargo or passengers. They're perfect for pleasure cruises, as they're easier and less expensive to operate than larger vessels.

A keelboat has the following features:

- **Light.** A hanging lantern or two casts bright light across the ship.  
- **Rigging.** Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.  
- **Sails.** The keelboat has one 10-foot-tall mast with sails.  

## Example Keelboat Crew

A keelboat requires a single crew member to operate smoothly. If the characters are guests on a keelboat, the crew consists of a single captain who has the statistics of a [bandit captain](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain-xmm.md) with proficiency with water vehicles.

## Keelboat Deck

The deck of the keelboat has the following features:

- **Ballista.** A ballista (DMG, ch. 8) is mounted on the fore of the deck. Ten ballista arrows are stacked and secured nearby.  
- **Oars.** The deck of the ship holds twelve benches and four 15-foot-long oars. When the ship is rowed, crew members sit on these benches to work the oars.  
- **Railing.** The deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.  

## Keelboat Cabin

The keelboat cabin has the following features:

- **Footlockers.** Beneath each bed is a footlocker. The footlockers are iron and have AC 19, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Furnishings.** Two beds and a desk with a chair stand at the aft of the cabin.

## Actions

On its turn, the keelboat can take 2 actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only 1 action if it has only one crew. It can't take these actions if it has no crew.

- **Fire Ballista.** The keelboat can fire its [ballista](2-Mechanics/CLI/objects/ballista-xdmg.md) (DMG, ch. 8).  
- **Move.** The keelboat can use its helm to move with its oars or sails.
