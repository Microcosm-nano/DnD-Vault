# Helm of Perfect Potential
*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/helm-of-perfect-potential.webp#right)


This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

## Random Properties

The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- 2 minor beneficial properties  
- 1 major beneficial property  
- 1 minor detrimental property  

## Master of Guile

While wearing the helm, you have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Wisdom ([Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks.

## Arrow of Elemental Havoc

As a bonus action while wearing the helm, you can launch a bolt of searing elemental energy toward a creature you can see within 90 feet of yourself. The target must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `4d6` acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

## Spellcasting

The helm has 6 charges and regains `1d6` charges each dawn. As an action while wearing the helm, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20): [elemental weapon](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/elemental-weapon-xphb.md) (1 charge), [call lightning](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/call-lightning-xphb.md) (2 charges), [wall of fire](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire-xphb.md) (3 charges), [conjure elemental](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental-xphb.md) (4 charges), [tsunami](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tsunami-xphb.md) (5 charges).
