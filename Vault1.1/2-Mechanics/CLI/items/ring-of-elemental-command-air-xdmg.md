# Ring of Elemental Command (Air)
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-elemental-command-air.webp#right)


The Ring of Elemental Command (air) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Air. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [Disadvantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you.  
- **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [Charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.  

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Air.** You know Auran, you have [Resistance](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Lightning damage, and you have a [Fly Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) and can hover.  

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [Chain Lightning](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chain-lightning-xphb.md) (3 charges), [Feather Fall](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feather-fall-xphb.md) (0 charges), [Gust of Wind](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md) (2 charges), [Wind Wall](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wind-wall-xphb.md) (1 charge)
