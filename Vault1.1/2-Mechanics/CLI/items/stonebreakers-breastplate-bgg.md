# Stonebreaker's Breastplate
*Medium armor ([breastplate](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/breastplate-xphb.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  


- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

This breastplate is made from marbled granite, though it feels no heavier than a typical metal breastplate. Its chest is emblazoned with the stone rune.

While wearing this breastplate, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and are immune to being knocked prone.

## Invoking the Rune

As an action, you can invoke the breastplate's rune to cast the [wall of stone](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone-xphb.md) spell (save DC 14) with it. When you cast the spell in this way, you have advantage on saving throws made to maintain [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on the spell.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
