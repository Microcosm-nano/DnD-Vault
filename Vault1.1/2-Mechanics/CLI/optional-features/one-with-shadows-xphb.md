# One with Shadows
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  
**Prerequisite**: 5th Warlock
While you're in an area of [Dim Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can cast [Invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot.
