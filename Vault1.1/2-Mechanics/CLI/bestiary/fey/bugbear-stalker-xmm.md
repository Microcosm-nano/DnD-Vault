# Bugbear Stalker
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 62. Available in the Free Rules (2024)*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/img/bugbears.webp#right)

Bugbear stalkers frequently take their victims hostage, relishing opportunities to imprison and terrorize other creatures.

Bugbears embody fear of the wilds and the menace of natural places. They're notoriously stealthy, and foes that venture into their territories often vanish without a trace.
