## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

***Corrosive Form.*** Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the ooze and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the ooze and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the [Mending](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mending-xphb.md) spell on the weapon.

The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal or wood in 1 round.

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+3`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 10 (`2d8 + 1`) Acid damage. Nonmagical armor worn by the target takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting the [Mending](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mending-xphb.md) spell on the armor.
