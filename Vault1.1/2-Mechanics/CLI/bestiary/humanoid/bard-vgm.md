Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide, but are commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

## Traits

***Song of Rest.*** The bard can perform a song while taking a short rest. Any ally who hears the song regains an extra `1d6` hit points if it spends any Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of that rest. The bard can confer this benefit on itself as well.

***Taunt (2/Day).*** The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** The bard is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, `+4` to hit with spell attacks). It has the following bard spells prepared:
