# Sahuagin Coral Smasher
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 249*  


Employed as frontline brutes in The Final Enemy, coral smashers are drawn from the ranks of the strongest sahuagin warriors. Their physical strength overcomes the resistance of the water as they swing their hammers at structures and foes with equal zeal.
