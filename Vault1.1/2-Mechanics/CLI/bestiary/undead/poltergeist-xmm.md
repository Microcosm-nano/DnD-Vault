## Poltergeist

*Malevolent or Mischievous Spirit*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Poltergeists are spirits that confuse and torment the living. While typically not visible, they sometimes appear as faded images of whoever they were in life. Some poltergeists don't realize they're dead and go through the motions of their past lives. Others are malicious beings or embodiments of fractured psyches that sow discord where they haunt.

Poltergeists telekinetically move objects in the places they lurk. Roll on or choose a result from the Poltergeist Activities table to inspire how a poltergeist menaces the living.

***Object Slam.*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) Bludgeoning damage.

***Telekinetic Thrust.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 12, one creature the poltergeist can see within 30 feet. *Failure:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) Force damage, and the target is pushed up to 30 feet straight away from the poltergeist.

## Bonus Actions

***Vanish.*** The poltergeist gives itself the [Invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition or ends that condition on itself.
