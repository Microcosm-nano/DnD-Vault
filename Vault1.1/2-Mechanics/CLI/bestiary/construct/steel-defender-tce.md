## Actions

***Force-Empowered Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. *Hit:* `1d8 + PB` force damage.

***Repair (3/Day).*** The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore `2d8 + PB` hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.
