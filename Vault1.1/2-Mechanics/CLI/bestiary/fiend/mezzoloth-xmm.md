# Mezzoloth

## Mezzoloth

*Yugoloth of Tenacity and Want*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Gehenna)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Mezzoloths are insectile yugoloths that seek power and souls in the service of fiendish lords. These greedy, violent yugoloths are more direct than most of their scheming brethren, but what they lack in guile they make up for in persistence and numbers.

Mezzoloths typically form mercenary bands with others of their kind. These forces serve more powerful yugoloths, other fiends, sinister mages, or anyone who provides them with tempting rewards. Mezzoloths obediently adhere to the bargains they strike, potentially serving their patrons for centuries, but once those terms expire, yesterday's client could become today's target. Roll on or choose a result from the Mezzoloth Payments table to inspire a mezzoloth's price for its services.
