## Traits

***Demonic Restoration.*** If the marilith dies outside the Abyss, its body dissolves into ichor, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) somewhere in the Abyss.

***Magic Resistance.*** The marilith has [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Reactive.*** The marilith can take one [Reaction](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) on every turn of combat.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 17, one Medium or smaller creature the marilith can see within 5 feet. *Failure:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) Bludgeoning damage. The target has the [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 14), and it has the [Restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the grapple ends.
