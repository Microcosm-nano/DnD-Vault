## Flumph

*Strange Ally from a Strange Place*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Arcana  

Bizarre creatures with aberrant agendas inhabit the Underdark. Flumphs number among the few that are helpful to strangers.

These tentacled, telepathic creatures jet through the air in short bursts, venting gases with a sound that gives them their name. Rather than speaking, flumphs communicate telepathically and by changing color to reflect their moods.

Flumphs dwell in psychically charged regions or near creatures with psionic magic. They harmlessly feed off psychic energies, but in doing so, they often encounter dangerous beings such as aboleths and mind flayers. While flumphs generally avoid combat, they often help adventurers in peril. Such help might be of doubtful use, but flumphs mean well. Roll on or choose a result from the Flumph Assistance table to inspire what support flumphs provide.

## Traits

***Advanced Telepathy.*** The flumph perceives the content of any telepathic communication within 60 feet of it.

***Prone Deficiency.*** If the flumph receives the [Prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition, roll a die. On an odd number, it has the [Incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, ending the [Incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition on a success.

***Telepathic Shroud.*** The flumph's thoughts can't be read by any means, and magic can't detect its location or observe it remotely.

## Actions

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 feet. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) Acid damage.

***Stench Spray (1/Day).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 10, one creature the flumph can see within 15 feet. *Failure:* The target is coated in a foul-smelling liquid, exudes a stench for `1d4` hours, and has the [Poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition while the stench lasts. Other creatures have the [Poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition while in a 5-foot [Emanation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the coated target. The target can remove the stench on itself if it bathes during a [Short](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
