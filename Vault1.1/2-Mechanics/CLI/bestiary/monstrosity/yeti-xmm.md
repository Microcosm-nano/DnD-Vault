# Yeti

![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/img/yeti.webp#right)

Yetis hunt alone or in small family groups. They avoid the settlements of other creatures but lurk near paths frequented by traders and herders to pick off unsuspecting prey. Yetis make their homes in icy caves near frozen peaks and at extremes where few dare travel.

## Yetis

*Chilling Stalkers of the Frozen Wilds*

- **Habitat.** Arctic  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Across alpine extremes and frozen frontiers, yetis hunt those that trespass in their territories. Reclusive and merciless, they resemble giant apes with pale fur and ram-like horns. Yetis easily blend in with snow and icy cliffs, revealing themselves with blood-chilling howls just before striking with their icy claws. In addition to their physical might, yetis can chill creatures with a look, freezing their foes in place, and they can conjure ice and hurl it at foes.

Due to yetis' elusiveness, folktales about yetis are more common than sightings. Whether a distant scream is the howl of an enraged yeti or just the wind, few can be certain. Nevertheless, many mountainous settlements burn bonfires to ward off yetis, taking advantage of these brutes' aversion to fire.
