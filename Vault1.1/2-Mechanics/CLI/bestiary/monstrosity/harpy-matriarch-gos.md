# Harpy Matriarch
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 237*  


Happy to watch its flock squabble over carrion in Tammeraut's Fate, this gray-feathered matron of the harpies is surrounded by a cloud of magical spirits resembling skeletal seabirds.

## Traits

***Luring Maestro.*** While within 60 feet of the matriarch, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the matriarch's Luring Song.

***Magic Resistance.*** The matriarch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The matriarch makes two claws attacks.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`3d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Fleeting Form.*** The matriarch can magically disguise itself to resemble a humanoid of roughly similar size and shape for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. This illusion does not hold up to close scrutiny.

***Luring Song.*** The matriarch sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the matriarch that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) until the song ends. The matriarch must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the matriarch is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

While [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the matriarch, a target is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target is more than 5 feet away from the matriarch, the target must move on its turn toward the matriarch by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this matriarch's song for the next 24 hours.

***Visage of Desire (1/Day).*** The matriarch projects a vision into the minds of creatures within 30 feet of it that aren't constructs or undead, showing each creature achieving whatever it most desires. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) until the end of its next turn.
