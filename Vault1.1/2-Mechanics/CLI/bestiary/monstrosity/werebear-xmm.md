## Werebear

*Changed by the Might of the Bear*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Forest, Hill  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

When threatened or compelled by magic, werebears shape-shift from their humanoid forms into mighty bears or hybrids of those two forms. They scare off or sabotage those who threaten the wilds, and they frequently aid Fey, druids, or spirits of the wilderness, as many owe their magical nature to such forces. Werebears take the shape of bears common to the regions in which they dwell, with brown and polar bear forms being common.

If the cursed target drops to 0 [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it instead becomes a Werebear under the DM's control and has 10 [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). *Success:* The target is immune to this werebear's curse for 24 hours.
