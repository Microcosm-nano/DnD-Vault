## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The toad can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The toad's [Long Jump](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md) is up to 20 feet and its [High Jump](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/high-jump-xphb.md) is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) Piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) Poison damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 12).

***Swallow.*** The toad swallows a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) but has the [Blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions, and it has [Total Cover](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects outside the toad. In addition, the target takes 10 (`3d6`) Acid damage at the end of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time, and it can't use Bite while it has a swallowed target. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [Restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [Prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.
