## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Spider Climb.*** If the swarm has a [Climb Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md), the swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+3`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 6 (`2d4 + 1`) Poison damage, or 3 (`1d4 + 1`) Poison damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md).
