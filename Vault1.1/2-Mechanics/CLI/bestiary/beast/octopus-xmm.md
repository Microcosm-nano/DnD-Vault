## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

***Water Breathing.*** The octopus can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 1 Bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

***Ink Cloud (1/Day).*** Trigger: A creature ends its turn within 5 feet of the octopus while underwater. _Response:_ The octopus releases ink that fills a 5-foot [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on itself, and the octopus moves up to its [Swim Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md). The [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
