## Basics

Obsidian refers to the collection of files you're browsing as a "Vault". I did not build this Vault from scratch. This vault was built by a DM known as Josh P. Please see the [[README]] and consider supporting him. I have heavily modified his original template vault to suit my needs. I hope you enjoy exploring it. Technical information is available in the [[README]], but most of what you need to know is on this page.

## Vault Structure

1.  DM Toolkit - This section is mostly for the DM or Loremaster. It contains the DM Screens which are excellent for looking up information for playing the game in addition to lots of  other various tools and stats for keeping track of the vault, such as the [[Vault Report]].
2. Mechanics - This folder is not meant to be looked through. It is for storage, but *can* be navigated for specific info. This folder contains the 2024 rules in addition to all of my other owned sourcebooks. It is referenced by the DM Toolkit often.
3. Party - This folder contains information on all of our characters and the players that play them.
4. Session Journals - This folder contains a record of each of our sessions.
5. Campaign - This folder contains information about various characters and features that exist within the campaign setting.
6. World - This folder contains information about the physical locations in the setting.

From a DM's Perspective, most of these folders will be useful.
As a player, much of the interesting content will be present in 3, 4, 5, and 6. I would discourage perusing too much through 1 or 2 so as to avoid potential spoilers.

###### DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EDIT THE 2-Mechanics FILES. MANY, MANY OTHER FILES IN THIS VAULT RELY ON THOSE FILES AS DEPENDENCIES.

### DID YOU READ THAT? DO NOT EDIT 2-Mechanics!

## Things to Know - Technical

- This vault is VERY MUCH a work in progress.
- On the upper-left, there is a pinned tab featuring the [[DM Screen|DM Screen]]. It is insanely useful for DMs.
- Content from the 2024 books are still buggy/unpolished.
- I generally try to avoid using AI art but sometimes it's the best thing I can find for a particular use case. I will try to keep it to a minimum.
- If this stuff interests you and you really want to get into editing or adding junk, let me know. I can help and this can be confusing to navigate on your own.
- The general [[README]]  is more for the tech side of things. Again, see the above bullet.

## Things to Know - Lore

- If you see a statblock on an NPC: It isn't true or significant! I'm just testing out the features of the vault and creating statblocks within it.
- I can add or change info on characters at the request of the character player.
- No one provided images for their character so character appearances are my headcannon.
- If someone thinks something/someone deserves a page in the vault, let me know.
- As of writing this, I will not be attempting to document or develop anything for past adventures. It would be too large an undertaking. I may change my mind at a later date.
- "Germanburg" was renamed to "Vetterlund". See the page linked below for additional details.
- ##### None of this is necessarily Cannon for the purposes of John's campaign!

# Let's Get Started!

You can navigate this vault using the folder structure on the left. You can preview other pages by hovering over colored links, and navigate to them by clicking on them. One of my favorite pages right now is the [[Emory Mountain Range]]. Give it a try!
