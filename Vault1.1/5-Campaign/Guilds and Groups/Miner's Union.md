## Overview

The Miner's Union (The Mining Workers Collective or MWC) is a labor union comprised of workers involved in the mining, processing, purification, and transport of mined goods. The Union is organized by chapters and has such chapters across Vetterlund. The Union uses collective bargaining to secure work as well as proper compensation and safe working conditions for it's members.

## Activities

The MWC has a market share of 61% across all certified mining operations in  Vetterlund. The MWC has the authority to authorize work stoppages, and strikes to leverage their influence on the industry to make sure their demands are met by the mining companies. Members are covered with medical policies and retirement benefits through the MWC as well.

## Society

Union membership is compulsory in MWC mines. Monthly meetings are held in each chapter to discuss current events in the industry and to vote on Actions.
Actions are any action that the Union will make when voted on by it's membership, whether it be a strike, an expense, or a reallocation of Union resources.

## History

The MWC was founded in Vetterlund 100 years ago as of this year. The struggle of laborers has been difficult and paved with blood. The historic and bloody strike of [[Maier]] was a large turning point in the history of the MWC
