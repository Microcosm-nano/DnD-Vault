> [!question]- Fusing Eyes
> When multiple Eyes of Aazimor are assembled in the same location by the same wielder, **they can be fused together**. This new Eye retains the spell abilities of both individual Eyes used to create it. The new Eye gains an additional charge.
> When the Eyes are fused in this way, the new Eye will have multiple Pupils on the surface of the Eye in different locations, and the Eye becomes slightly larger.
 > 
>  *The new Eye still requires only one [[attunement-xphb|Attunement]] slot. If the wielder of the Eyes is already attuned to three Magic Items, the attunement requirement for the additional Eye is ignored for the purposes of fusion.*

> [!example]- Sentient Item
> Many Magic Items are the host of a variety of sentient entities. Previous wielders, lost souls, artificial intelligences, and manifestations of powerful emotions are all examples of a sentient entity that may be present within a magic item. These entities will often communicate with, or otherwise influence the actions of the attuned wielder.
> 
> *This item contains a piece of Aazimor, the ancient [[beholder|Beholder]].*

> [!danger]- Cursed Item
> This item is likely to be cursed in some way. The precise nature of this curse is currently unknown. Exercise caution when using or attuning to this item.
> 
> *Other spellcasters who have attuned to an Eye of Aazimor have acted erratically and violently. It should be assumed their mental state was altered in some way.*

*An eye of an ancient [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder-xmm|Beholder]], Aazimor. It has multiple, varying,  strange properties depending on which Eye is being used.*
