## Overview

A museum in Illsprout has been locked up for months. It has a collection of odd exhibitions of occult nature.

### Scenery
![[Oddities.webp|800]]

*The Museum, though silent as the grave, felt alive. It's walls lined with a menagerie of  trinkets, baubles, and eccentricities left the viewer both perplexed and altogether uneasy. Taxidermized creatures fill the showroom floor as a mecabre reminder of the stiffness of rigor mortis.*

## Notable People & Creatures
- [[Abram Mercutio]]
- The Soul in the Mirror
- Taxidermized creatures

## History

As the proprietor of the museum, Mercutio has owned the property for many years. Serving previously as an alchemical supply, the building was well suited for being converted into a showroom for the dark magic and occult items being collected for display by the curator. While never quite the safest attraction, guests could rest easy knowing the curator was highly knowledgeable and capable of preventing the guests of the museum from harm. Until recently, the museum has been open to the public. It has been closed off and locked for the last few months now.
