## History

Geldfelder was settled by [[dwarf-xphb#Description|Dwarves]] centuries ago, long before the first [[human-xphb#Description|Humans]] arrived in the region. When the first Humans arrived in the region they were attracted to the resources the poppy fields surrounding the valley provided. The rolling hills of Geldfelder hadn't originally been considered as a viable location for a mine. Similar valley regions were considered by speculators and miners as an unwise location for a mine, and based on initial inspections, the valley was considered to be geologically barren of valuable minerals and ore. In the early days of the construction of the town, however, construction of a well began at the edge of town, near an old Dwarven ruin. It's said that about 18 feet down, the miner working to dig the well struck a massive deposit of gold. The well area was quickly dug out more and more, with gold continuing to be discovered. The well project was quickly abandoned and a proper mining facility sprung up at the edge of the town at the foot of the ruins. After a few years, the entire town had radically changed from the sudden influx of wealth and workers seeking riches in the mines. For this reason, Geldfelder is one of the first towns in the region to have been affected by the massive influx, and eventually replacement of the Dwarven populace by Humans, a trend that would eventually follow across the entire [[Emory Mountain Range]], known by the Dwarves as the Returning.
