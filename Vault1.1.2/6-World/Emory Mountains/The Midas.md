## Overview

The Midas is the prized gold mine of [[Geldfelder]]. Many of it's citizens have worked in the mine for centuries, dating back to the age of the [[dwarf-xphb|Dwarves]] . The dwarves mined here long before it's earliest [[human-xphb|Human]] inhabitants, and many Dwarven secrets still lurk in the depths.

### Scenery
![[The Midas 1.jpg| 500]]

*The sprawling caverns and tunnels of The Midas are vast and awe-inspiring. Such is the vastness of The Midas, that a small town of miners has been formed underground, going about their day-to-day business without ever seeing the sunlight.*

## History

The Midas has existed as a mine in some form for at least a few hundred years, since the town's settlement by Humans. The entrance to The Midas is located on the eastern edge of town at the base of a large hill, atop which is an obelisk of dwarven contruction. The Mine broke ground almost immediately after  gold ore was discovered during construction of a well. The mine became an instant success and began to expand along with the expanding town of Geldfelder. Travelers would come from far and wide across the Vetterlund in search of work, and by extension, wealth and fortune.  The Midas, as it would come to be known, generated impressive prosperity for the denizens and miners of Geldfelder. Sometime after the vassalization of the Vetterlund by the Azlaphate Empire, the Midas became an important source of wealth and currency for the empire. Geldefelders would go on to recieve much less of the wealth they mined as a large portion of it would be exported to support the Azlaphate's need for gold and a standardized currency. As such, Geldfelder's "Golden Age" came to a conclusion after the vassalization of the Vetterlund. After extensive mining, miners eventually came upon a dwarven ruin buried deep in the earth. It was decidedly left alone until fairly recently.

## Dwarven Ruins

At the bottom of The Midas, buried deep in the earth, lies a dwarven ruin. The Obelisk on the surface alludes to the structure. The Ruin was a prison for an ancient Lupine named Abberis. On a wall of  the ruin, a mural depicts a conflict between the Dwarven folk hero William Elliot, and Abberiss. The conflict between humility and greed, good and evil, is steeped in long lost legend. The lupine Aberriss however, is sealed and imprisoned here, evermore. Traps and puzzles are abundant in this ancient ruin.

> Abberiss is the name of a powerful, ancient Lupine. He was imprisoned in this tomb long ago by the Dwarven folk hero, William Elliot. Sealed here in a cavern of gold, a symbol of his greed, Abberiss could no longer horde the lives of mortals.

> A Lupine is a [[monstrosity]], resembling a [[werewolf|Werewolf]] with unique abilities that make it particularly powerful. A Lupine can *"Mark"* victims as future carriers of the Lupine itself. When the body of the Lupine perishes, the victim most recently marked in this way will undergo a painful death of self as they transform into the Lupine. The Lupine retains all of it's memories. The Lupine will horde not only wealth and gold, but will horde mortal lives and souls, bound in service to the Lupine. The more mortal lives they mark, the more future hosts the Lupine will have, and as such, the more powerful its becomes.
