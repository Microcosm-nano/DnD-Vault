## Overview

The Nest is the primary location and hideout for [[The Murder]]. It is in an abandoned castle estate complete with courtyard, walls, and portcullis. The fortification is in fair condition despite being abandoned (or commandeered from) its previous owners

### Scenery

![[The Nest.jpg|700]]

*The Nest looms gravely upon the writhing black branches of this accursed forest. It's crows turn their wretched heads and meet the gaze of any who roam here, snapping twigs underfoot like discarded ribs. Black riders trample foolhardy wayfarers with black mounts. Hooves of black now stained in pools of black blood. Even the pitiful creatures of the wood have long since abandoned it. And then, just when all hope is lost; when the foolish trespasser realizes there is no escape from this accursed weald? They are hunted and they are found. The worst becomes of them: The Corvid.*

## History

Very little is known of what the fortification was used for before The Murder took residence here. It was likely the residence of a wealthy lord from the nearby village of [[Herzloch]]. Today it is the home of The Murder and the dark rituals and evil acts they practice there.
