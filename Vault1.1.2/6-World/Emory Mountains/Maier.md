*Autumnal Village with Cart - Unknown Artist
"This Impressionist watercolor piece has hung in our town hall for some forty years now. The ability to invoke imagery of the town without recalling specific details and using blurry, blotchy shapes is an impressive testament to the talent of the artist. I like to think that as our memories fade over time, many travelers will remember Maier looking quite similar to this painting. It's a pleasant thought to have isn't it? That people can remember these scenes with fondness even if we remember them imperfectly." - Sansa, Maier's Librarian*

## History

Maier was founded as a company town by the *Maier & Sons Coal and Salt Company* due to it's proximity to the colossal sheer cliffs nearby. These large walls are perfect for mining into. Many mines line the edges of the town and a processing and transport network was developed to create a booming salt industry, which serves the majority of the [[Emory Mountain Range]] as well as much of Vetterlund. Although economically successful, Maier's workers struggled economically due to practices such as company-owned housing and company stores. Workers also struggled politically due to lacking elected officials and municipally owned services. Â Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs, and therefore felt dictated to. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in tensions. In 238A, the [[Miner's Union]]  voted to strike, resulting in the Maier & Sons Company calling to the Vetterlund army. Vetterlund mobilized a battalion of cuirassiers, men-at-arms, and infantrymen to occupy and stabilize the company town. Rising tensions reached a tipping point  in February of 239A when a bloody battle broke out between the miners and soldiers. The "Massacre of Maier" as it is sometimes referred to by locals lasted for over 3 hours and resulted in the deaths of over a hundred miners and three dozen Vetterlund soldiers. By some coincidence or miracle, the company owners and administrators were also killed in the conflict. As a result of the strike and battle, the company was effectively dismantled and the town was incorporated as an independent Hamlet, no longer subject to the company. Despite high tensions between the soldiers and remaining miners, the strikers demands had been met by the dissolution of the company, and the battalion was no longer beheld to occupy the town. The strike was officially  lifted in March of 239A. The battalion remained for two months to work a civil works project to create a new cemetery for the hamlet to accommodate the dead from the battle. Today, Maier has one of the largest cemeteries in the region, and a monument to the miners lost in the battle stands in the town square.
