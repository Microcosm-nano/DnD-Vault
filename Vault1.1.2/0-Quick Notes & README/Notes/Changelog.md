## 1.1

### General
1.  Added Changelog.
	1. I did this at the end, so I don't remember everything new in this version. I will keep better track of this in future versions.
2. Revamped most of the tables relating to characters and stats.
3. Many properties were altered to appear as links instead of raw text.
	1. Ideally most info should autopopulate in link form. This will be a goal of mine moving forward.
4. Added Testing grounds
5. Tweaked some Readme instructions to be more clear.
6. Changed the code for displaying and filtering the player's Magic Items on the [[DM Party Info]] screen. This was a surprisingly difficult process. Big thanks to Rob!
7. Used a new CLI scrape method to fix unloaded image issues. This significantly increases the size of the vault, but at ~1.0 Gb I'm not too worried about it's size. All of the images and content for the 2024 rules should be polished now!
8. Added "Ships and Nautical resources" to the DM screen for John's enjoyment. These rules appear in the Ghosts of Saltmarsh Adventure book.
9. Removed Herobrine
