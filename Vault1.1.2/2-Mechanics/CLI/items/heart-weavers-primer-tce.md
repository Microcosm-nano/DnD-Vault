# Heart Weaver's Primer
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  


- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [antipathy/sympathy](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antipathy-sympathy-xphb.md), [charm person](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person-xphb.md), [dominate person](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-person-xphb.md), [enthrall](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enthrall-xphb.md), [hypnotic pattern](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hypnotic-pattern-xphb.md), [modify memory](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/modify-memory-xphb.md), and [suggestion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion-xphb.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.  
- When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
