# Wrathful Smite
*1st-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

The target takes an extra `1d6` Necrotic damage from the attack, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [Frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Warlock (The Hexblade)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock-xphb-the-hexblade-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Paladin](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
