# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), it has [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [Attack](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) (one attack only), [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Utilize](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action.

When the spell ends, the target is [Incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and has a [Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.
