# Darkness
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical [Darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [Darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) or [Dim Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Shadow Magic)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-shadow-magic-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Wizard (Evoker)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Monk (Warrior of Shadow)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-monk-xphb-warrior-of-shadow-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Bard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md)
