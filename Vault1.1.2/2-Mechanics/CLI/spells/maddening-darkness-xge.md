# Maddening Darkness
*8th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a drop of pitch mixed with a drop of mercury)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through this darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking `8d8` psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Classes**: [Wizard (Evoker)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Bard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
