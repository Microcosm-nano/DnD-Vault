# Catnap
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Artificer](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](2-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md)
