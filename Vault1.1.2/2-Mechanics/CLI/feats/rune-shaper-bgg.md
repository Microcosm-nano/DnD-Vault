# Rune Shaper
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 18*  
**Prerequisite**: Spellcasting feature or [Rune Carver](2-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/rune-carver-bgg.md)
You've studied the magic of Giant runes, granting you the following benefits:

- **Comprehend Languages.** You learn the [comprehend languages](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages-xphb.md) spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.  
- **Rune Magic.** You know a number of runes equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), chosen from the Rune Spells table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can inscribe each rune you know onto one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you touch. You temporarily learn the 1st-level spells that correspond to the runes you inscribed, as specified on the Rune Spells table, and you know those spells until you finish a long rest, when the runes fade. While you are wearing or carrying any rune-marked object, you can cast the spells associated with those runes using any spell slots you have.  

    You can also invoke a rune inscribed on an object you are wearing or carrying and cast its associated spell without expending a spell slot or using material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Your spellcasting ability for this feat is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).  

    Each time you gain a level, you can replace one of the runes you know with another one from the Rune Spells table.
