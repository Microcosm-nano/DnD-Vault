**Against the Giants**

`dice: [](against-the-giants-bgg.md#^against-the-giants)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Adventurers find a village completely deserted, with tracks leading to a hill giant steading. Can they rescue the surviving villagers and livestock before the [hill giants](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/hill-giant-xmm.md) eat them all? |
| 2 | A family of [stone giants](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-xmm.md) fell under the sway of Lolth and allied with Lolth-worshiping drow to raid the surface. Adventurers must break the alliance or eliminate the stone giants if necessary. |
| 3 | An especially harsh winter is accompanied by roving bands of [frost giants](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant-xmm.md) and [winter wolves](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf-xmm.md) preying on travelers. |
| 4 | [Fire giants](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant-xmm.md) send [hell hounds](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound-xmm.md) into mine tunnels to chase the miners out, then send their own azer servants to plunder the mineral-rich mines. The miners seek help to reclaim their mines. |
| 5 | A clever [cloud giant](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant-xmm.md) plays several other powerful creatures against each other and against nearby Humanoids. Eliminating the giant will return the volatile situation to an uneasy status quo. |
| 6 | A [frost giant](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/frost-giant-xmm.md) leads a mixed band of weaker giants in a campaign of bloodlust to honor Thrym or a demon lord. |
| 7 | After a villainous group slays a young [storm giant](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant-xmm.md), the giant's parent unleashes an undiscriminating campaign of vengeance against any "interfering little gnats" living nearby. |
| 8 | As characters explore a steading belonging to one kind of giant (you can roll a `d6` on this table to decide why the characters are there), they discover an honored guest of a more powerful giant kind who is coordinating the weaker giants' activities. |
