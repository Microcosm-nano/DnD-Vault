# Ultroloth

## Ultroloth

*Yugoloth of Conspiracy and Control*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Lower Planes)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

With uncanny patience and fiendish cunning, ultroloths manipulate mortals and their fellow yugoloths alike, seeking to hoard power and spread suffering. These sinister masterminds often work with other yugoloths, but they might compel nearly any creature into their service. If coercion doesn't work, ultroloths use their eerie eyes and innate magic to hypnotize or charm targets.

Ultroloths strive to achieve planes-spanning plots. Roll on or choose a result from the Ultroloth Conspiracies table to inspire such villainy.
