# Swarm of Dretches
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 104*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/img/dretches.webp#right)

Swarms of dretches sometimes escape the Abyss onto other planes of existence, or they might be part of a demonic invasion. Without direction, these crude demons rampage and despoil with cruel enthusiasm.

## Dretches

*Demons of Frenzy and Vulgarity*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** None  

The servants and victims of greater demons, dretches embody petty instincts, chaotic impulses, and violent urges. Dretches exist in unfathomable numbers in the depths of the Abyss, where their reeking throngs fill vast demonic hordes.

## Traits

***Fetid Aura.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 12, any creature that starts its turn in a 10-foot [Emanation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the swarm. *Failure:* The target has the [Poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the start of its next turn. While [Poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), the target can take either an action or a [Bonus Action](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) on its turn, not both, and it can't take Reactions.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Small creature. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes two Rend attacks.

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 12 (`3d6 + 2`) Slashing damage, or 9 (`3d4 + 2`) Slashing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md).
