## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the unicorn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The unicorn has [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The unicorn casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At will**: [Detect Evil and Good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Druidcraft](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/druidcraft-xphb.md)

**1/day each**: [Calm Emotions](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/calm-emotions-xphb.md), [Dispel Evil and Good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Entangle](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/entangle-xphb.md), [Pass without Trace](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace-xphb.md), [Word of Recall](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/word-of-recall-xphb.md)

***Unicorn's Blessing (3/Day).*** The unicorn touches another creature with its horn and casts [Cure Wounds](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds-xphb.md) or [Lesser Restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md) on that creature, using the same spellcasting ability as Spellcasting.

**3/day**: [Cure Wounds](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds-xphb.md), [Lesser Restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The unicorn makes one Hooves attack and one Radiant Horn attack.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+7`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) Bludgeoning damage.

***Radiant Horn.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+7`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 9 (`1d10 + 4`) Radiant damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Charging Horn.*** The unicorn moves up to half its [Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) without provoking Opportunity Attacks, and it makes one Radiant Horn attack.

***Shimmering Shield.*** The unicorn targets itself or one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target gains 10 (`3d6`) [Temporary Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md), and its AC increases by 2 until the end of the unicorn's next turn. The unicorn can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

## Regional effects

The region containing a unicorn's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Obscuring Foliage.** The unicorn and its allies have [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Positive Energy.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) from a spell, it regains the maximum number of [Hit Points](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) possible. Additionally, the effects of curses are suppressed within 1 mile of the lair.  

If the unicorn dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
