## Traits

***Animal Lordship.*** An animal lord represents a Forager, Hunter, or Sage (DM's choice), which determines certain traits in this stat block.

***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If the animal lord fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Lordly Presence.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 20, any enemy that starts its turn in a 30-foot [Emanation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the animal lord. *Failure:* The target takes 10 (`3d6`) Psychic damage, and the target is magically bewildered until the end of its next turn. While bewildered, the target subtracts `1d4` from its saving throws.

***Magic Resistance.*** The animal lord has [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**At will**: [Animal Friendship](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship-xphb.md), [Animal Messenger](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-messenger-xphb.md), [Speak with Animals](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals-xphb.md)
