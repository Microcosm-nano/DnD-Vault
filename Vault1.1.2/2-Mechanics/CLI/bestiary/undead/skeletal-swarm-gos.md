# Skeletal Swarm
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 254*  


This swarm of bones found rising out of the sand in Isle of the Abbey is made from the remains of several animated skeletons. A skeletal swarm alternates its appearance between partially formed humanoid shapes and a chaotic, swirling mass.

## Traits

***Deafening Clatter.*** Creatures are [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) while in the swarm's space.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Small humanoid. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Slash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 11 (`2d8 + 2`) slashing damage, or 6 (`1d8 + 2`) slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
