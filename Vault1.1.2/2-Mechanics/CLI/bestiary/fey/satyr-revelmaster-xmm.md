## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The satyr makes three Prance attacks.

***Prance.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+7`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) Bludgeoning damage, and the target has the [Charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start of the satyr's next turn.

***Fey Melody (Recharge 4-6).*** The satyr conjures a charming or frightening song. *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 14, each enemy in a 60-foot [Emanation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the satyr. *Failure:* The target is subjected to the song's effect:

- **Charming.** The target has the [Charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition for 1 minute. While [Charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the target has the [Incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition and uses all its movement to dance in place. The effect ends on the target if it takes any damage.  
- **Frightening.** 10 (`2d6 + 3`) Psychic damage, and the target has the [Frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for 1 minute. If the target ends its turn out of line of sight from the satyr, the condition ends on it.
