# Bandit Crime Lord
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 28*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/img/bandit-crime-lord.webp#right)

Bandit crime lords manipulate shadowy organizations and prioritize their own survival over any single lackey or plot.

## Bandits

*Criminals and Scoundrels*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders.

Roll on or choose a result from the Bandit Motivations table to determine the circumstances behind a bandit's crimes.

## Traits

***Evasion.*** If the bandit is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the bandit instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it has the [Incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bandit makes three attacks, using Scimitar or Pistol in any combination.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+9`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) Slashing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) Poison damage.

***Pistol.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* `+9`, range 30/90 ft. *Hit:* 10 (`1d10 + 5`) Piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) Poison damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Deadly Aim.*** The bandit gives itself [Advantage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes during the current turn. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 28 (`8d6`) Poison damage.
