# Thri-kreen Marauder
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 306*  
![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/img/thri-kreen.webp#right)

Thri-kreen marauders employ weapons made of stone and bone, such as the spear-like gythka and throwing blades called chatkcha.

## Thri-kreen

*Mantid Psychics and Scavengers*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Grassland  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Thri-kreen are mantis-like wanderers who harness their innate camouflage and psychic abilities to survive. Different groups of thri-kreen have distinct carapaces, from the rocky shades of desert dwellers to the vibrant hues of those living in verdant lands. While their language has a distinctly insectile quality, thri-kreen often use telepathy to communicate, and groups can rapidly share a wealth of detailed information without making a sound.

> I would tell you now the tale of the first Ka'Cha, the first thri-kreen who knew and taught the truth: that the clutch is all.
