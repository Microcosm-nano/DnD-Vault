# Aerosaur

![](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/img/aerosaur.webp#right)

A pterosaur the size of the most ancient dragons, an aerosaur boasts a wingspan of nearly 200 feet. Elemental energy traces patterns like lightning across its scales, giving additional thunderous power to the beating of its enormous wings.

## Dinosaurs

When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The aerosaur has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The aerosaur makes one Bite attack and one Talons attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (`3d12 + 8`) piercing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition, and the aerosaur can't Bite another target.

***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`3d10 + 8`) slashing damage.

***Wing Gusts (Recharge 5-6).*** The aerosaur beats its wings, creating bursts of thunderous force. Each creature within 10 feet of the aerosaur must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (`7d10`) thunder damage, is pushed up to 30 feet horizontally from the aerosaur, and has the [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed up to 15 feet horizontally from the aerosaur.
