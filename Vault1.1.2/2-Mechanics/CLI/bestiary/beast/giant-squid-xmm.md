## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Water Breathing.*** The squid can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The squid makes one Bite attack and one Tentacle attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+9`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 28 (`4d10 + 6`) Piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+9`, reach 15 ft. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 16) from one of two tentacles, and the squid can pull the target up to 10 feet straight toward itself.

## Reactions

***Ink Cloud (1/Day).*** Trigger: The squid takes damage while underwater. _Response:_ The squid releases ink that fills a 15-foot [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on itself, and the squid moves up to its [Swim Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md). The [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
