## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Water Breathing.*** The octopus can breathe only underwater. It can hold its breath for 1 hour outside water.

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+5`, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 13) from all eight tentacles. While [Grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled), the target has the [Restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.

## Reactions

***Ink Cloud (1/Day).*** Trigger: The octopus takes damage while underwater. _Response:_ The octopus releases ink that fills a 10-foot [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on itself, and the octopus moves up to its [Swim Speed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md). The [Cube](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
