# Rowboat
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 190*  

The humble rowboat serves to ferry passengers back and forth from larger ships or to navigate lakes and rivers. Due to its simple, versatile design, a rowboat has no decks or typical crew. Weighing 100 pounds, a rowboat is easy to transport and might be carried by larger ships.
