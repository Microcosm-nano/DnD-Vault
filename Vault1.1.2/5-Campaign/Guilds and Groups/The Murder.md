The group consisted of a powerful necromancer, a cohort of [[spellcasting-xge|Spellcasting]] apprentices, and an enforcer. The enforcer role was formerly held by [[Rowan|Corvid]], and later, The Cyclops (Deceased). Their influence and power spread by means of a massive army of the undead.

## Activities

The Murder engages in a multitude of criminal activities in and around [[Herzloch]]. Severim carries out the majority of these acts either directly, or indirectly through his [[undead]].

- Extorsion, threats, bribery, blackmail, etc. of local businesses and citizens

## Etymology

The Murder is so named after the collective noun for crows. much of their aesthetic and iconography lend from corvidae as well.

## History

The Murder has been in power in Herzloch for years now. Though mostly defunct after their decimation at the hands of [[The Yam Court]], their leader [[Sien Severim]] lives on. The only other known surviving member of the gang, [[Rowan]], is on a quest for revenge to destroy the remnants of the gang.
