## Overview

The Friarsons are a paramilitary mercenary group originally based out of [[Revachol]]. In recent years they have become complacent in their new surroundings with little opposition. They have devolved and transitioned into a gang, outmatching the power and influence to that of the [[The Murder]].

## Activities

- The Friarsons will still engage in mercenary work for the highest bidder
- Extorsion via protection schemes
- Military quality training of "recruits"

## Society

As a paramilitary organization,  The Friarsons rely on a multitude of methods and tactics that a real military uses. These include practices such as: a chain of command, boot camp for recruits, court marshalling of insubordination, and an impressive accumulation of vehicles, resources, and weaponry. The chain of command goes from the recruits on the bottom all the way up to their leader Capt. Henry Friarson.

## History

Originally based out of [[Revachol]], The Friarsons were a mercenary group that would offer services to the highest bidder. They were known for their success rate and ability to carry out highly specific orders normally too difficult for standard mercenary outfits. Vetterlund called upon the Firarsons from overseas as private soldiers for the country, but funds began to slow from Vetterlund as the country was recovering from it's most recent clash with the encroaching Azlaphate Empire. The Friarsons were now in a position where they were no longer being compensated, and Vetterlund had no competent military force to oppose them. They decided under the direction of Capt. Henry Friarson to occupy a portion of the [[Emory Mountain Range]]. They have since forcibly quartered in residences and municipal facilites in Traumich. They dictate to locals as an authoritarian entity, and have eyes on expanding their influence elsewhere. They have on multiple occasions clashed with a rivaling gang with a longer presence in the region, [[The Murder]].
