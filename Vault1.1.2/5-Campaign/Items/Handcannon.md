The Handcannon has a max of six charges. The Handcannon replenishes 1D6 charges every day at dawn. The [[spells|spell]] produced by the Handcannon is dependent on the color of the *highly valuable* [[crystal-xphb|Crystal]] in the sights of the weapon, without which, the item is useless. Crystals can be exchanged on the Handcannon as a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]]. Using the Handcannon causes a resounding *BOOM* that can be heard up to a mile away. The effects of the various crystals are listed in the table below.
