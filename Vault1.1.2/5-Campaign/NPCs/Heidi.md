## Biography

Heidi intercepted [[The Yam Court]] during their stay and investigation into the mysterious hamlet of [[Maier]] to inform them of the False Hydra plaguing the hamlet. Heidi is deaf and is therefore immune to the "song" of the False Hydra.

## Personality

Quick and to the point, perhaps out of necessity. Heidi makes sure to inform [[The Yam Court]] to the dangers ahead of them as soon as possible. She is merciful and brave. She is unafraid to face danger head on and is quick to forgive the party even after being attacked at first.

## Abilities

- Deaf and uninfluenced by the False Hydra
- Proficient in Sign Language.
- A competent combatant.
- "Stands on business"
