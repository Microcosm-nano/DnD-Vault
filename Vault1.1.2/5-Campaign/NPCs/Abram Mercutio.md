## Biography

Mercutio was a talented young spellcaster when admitted to the [[Herzloch College of the Arcane]]. After it's closure, Abram would continue his studies and specialize in studying the occult. He would eventually open up a museum, [[Mercutio's Mysterious Museum of Oddities]], where he could display the various artifacts and oddities he curated over his academic career. At some point in the last few months, Abram came into the possession of two [[Eye of Aazimor]]. The Artifacts drove him to madness and he subsequently closed off his museum. He magically conjured a violent [[aberration]] during the Yam Festival of [[Illsprout]], and was swiftly defeated by the newly crowned [[The Yam Court| Yam Court]].
