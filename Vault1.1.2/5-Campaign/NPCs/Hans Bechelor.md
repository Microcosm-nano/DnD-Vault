## Biography

Hans Bechelor was a powerful spellcaster in Vetterlund. He became the [[archmage|Archmage]] of the [[Herzloch College of the Arcane]] where he taught and administrated for several years. At some point he became fascinated, or perhaps, *obsessed* with the Old Ones of the Far Realms. At some point approximately 20 years ago, Bechelor performed a long forgotten and powerful ritual tied to the Old One [[greyhawk-tharizdun-xdmg|Tharizdun]]. The Senior Arcanist of the college [[Wilhelm Wilthang]] interrupted the ritual and sent them both hurtling into the abyss of the Astral Sea. During the ritual and subsequent shifting of planes, Bechelor had been transmuted into some foul and otherworldly creature. It is here where Bechelor was bested and presumably killed by Wilthang.

## Abilities

Before his expulsion from the Material Plane, Bechelor was a powerful [[Wizard|Wizard]] and spellcaster, worthy of the title of [[archmage|Archmage]]. He was also intimately familiar with occult and extraplanar secrets required to perform powerful rituals tied to the entities of the Far Realms.

## Elevation

During his ritual and subsequent transformation, Hans was *elevated* to a new otherworldly form. The nature and abilities of this form are largely unknown, though incredibly powerful.

## Eyes of Aazimor

Bechelor has *"Assimilated"* two [[Eye of Aazimor]] into himself. The consequences of this are largely unknown.
