## Biography

Sien was born in Traumich in the [[Emory Mountain Range]] where he spent much of his childhood. He quickly learned of his innate magical abilities; particularly his affinity for necromancy. After a bout of fascination with experimenting on small animals and bringing various rats, chickens, and neighborhood cats back to life, Sien was eventually caught by his parents Savian and Sevennah. They were deeply troubled with their child's behavior and were unsure how to discipline him, especially given that they believed Sien may have been killing the small animals himself to experiment on. Sien's father Savian decided he would ban Sien from practicing any magic whatsoever. After months of tantrums and fits from the young Sien, there was a breaking point. Neighbors aren't sure exactly what transpired, but magical anomalies began occurring each night in the village. [[Hans Bechelor]] was tasked with investigating the magical anomalies and found the young Severim was the cause, with both of his parents having been reanimated. Horrified, yet intrigued by the magical promise of the child, Bechelor considered turning him to the Traumich dungeons, but he decided the child would be far more useful as a student of the arcane.

Sien, under the sponsorship of Bechelor, began studies at the [[Herzloch College of the Arcane]] where he was a very talented and successful pupil.  Sien continued his necromantic experiments there in secret. After the college was shuttered due to a magical cataclysm, Sien was able to begin studying the necromantic arts full-time. As a homeless orphan with nowhere else to go, Sien also turned to a life of crime at this time.

After some years spent in obscurity, Sien eventually founded the gang known now as [[The Murder]]. By raising an army of undead and amassing influence and wealth, other gangs and criminals in the region were beginning to take notice and certain criminal talents were attracted to the gang. Sien knew he would need help in the form of an enforcer. He needed someone he could trust to make things happen when simpleminded undead wouldn't be sufficient. It was around this time when he met [[Rowan| Isaac]]. He recruited Isaac from an illicit mercenary group after hearing of his competency in combat, and knowing he was dissatisfied with his current position in his criminal enterprise. [[The Murder]] would go on to control the entirety of [[Herzloch]] and he would attempt to expand across the entire region, before being  slowed by the introduction of [[The Friarsons]] to the region.

## Relationships

Sien is famously antisocial. Even among his peers in college he was considered distant and anthropophobic. It is likely that Sien would run his gang entirely alone if it were possible. As a result, he has very few meaningful relationships. He maintains a Master/apprentice relationship with his apprentices. He has had only two underlings he regards with some degree of respect: [[Rowan|Corvid]], and his successor, "The Cyclops".

## Personality

Sien is a cold, calculating, and hateful individual. He completely disregards the value of life and the living, far more concerned with death and undeath. Most of his interactions with others are full of chastisement and condemnations for their perceived lack of care or skill. He is also a tactical genius, often anticipating the future actions of others and preparing appropriately. His gang was able to survive for so long thanks in part to his foresight. Unfortunately, his foresight is lacking in certain aspects, given his asocial nature. He often finds it difficult to understand the emotions and intensions of others.

## Abilities

Sien is an extremely talented [[Sorcerer|Sorcerer]] with notable achievements in [[list-spells-school-necromancy|Necromancy Spells]] and [[list-spells-school-evocation|Evocation Spells]]. He is able to command hordes of [[undead]] simultaneously. He also maintains a massive network of familiars who act as his eyes and ears across his zones of control. In addition to his matrix of familiars, his [[scrying-xphb|Scrying]] abilities are noteworthy as well.

Sien is also a talented manipulator, employing a variety of blackmail and extorsion techniques to get what he wants out of his enemies. Fear tactics are also made use of by his enforcers. Sien has a gift for creating an environment in which it is easier to simply comply with him than to put up any resistance.
