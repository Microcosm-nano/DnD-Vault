## Biography

Wilhelm of [[Clan Wilthang]] was raised in Castle Wilthang with his brother. The two would eventually have a falling-out and would cause Wilhelm's departure from his ancestral home in addition to abandoning The Path of the Wilthangs. Wilhelm instead dedicated his life to the study of Astrology and the Cosmos of the Astral Plane. He would go on to pursue an academic career at the [[Herzloch College of the Arcane]] and during this time he would become a professor of  young [[Sien Severim]], and [[Abram Mercutio]]. It is also here where he worked alongside [[Hans Bechelor]]. His academic career would continue until the closing of the college due to a magical cataclysm caused by Bechelor. Wilhelm interrupted a ritual of Bechelors, causing the cataclysm. He and Bechelor were transported to somewhere in the far realms where Wilhelm defeated the now transformed and hostile Bechelor. Today, Wilhelm lives a quiet, hermetic life of study where he continues his work analyzing the Far Realms and the Astral Plane.

## Relationships

- Wilhelm is not on speaking terms with his brother, nor the elder members of [[Clan Wilthang]].
- Wilhelm has recently become acquainted with his nephew and niece, [[Frank]] and [[Maeve]] Wilthang with whom he has a better, albeit standoffish relationship.
- Wilhelm regards [[Sien Severim]] and [[The Murder]] as dangerous enemies. He takes any precaution possible to protect himself from them.
- Wilhelm kept an academic relationship with [[Abram Mercutio]] up until recently. Mercutio hasn't responded to communications from Wilhelm for some time now.
- Wilhelm believes [[Hans Bechelor]] may return in some form or another.

## Personality

Wilhelm has a host of eccentricities and is often far too focused or lost in research to pay any mind to those in front of him. It can also be difficult to gain his trust as he doesn't often open up to people who he doesn't know well. When he is brought out of his research and comes out of his shell, he tends to be a gracious host and an avid conversationalist, though most of his most passionate topics of discussion still tend to revolve around the subject of his research. He truly exhibits the perfect qualities of a lifelong academic and as such, has become a trusted expert in his field. While he appears to be messy and unorganized he always has a "method to the madness".

## Abilities

Wilhelm Is an expert in multiple academic fields and has a breadth of knowledge across various arcane subjects. He is also a talented [[Wizard|Wizard]] and capable of [[spellcasting-xge|Spellcasting]].
